# Kernel — implementation plan

This is the build plan for the system described in [ARCHITECTURE.md](ARCHITECTURE.md).
The architecture doc says *what* and *why*. This doc says *how*, *in what order*, and
*how we know each piece is done*.

Conventions: **MUST** means required for the phase to count as done. **Later** means
explicitly deferred. Estimates assume one person working focused, and they're rough.

## 1. Scope of v1

**v1 is done when**, for a week of daily use:

- I can start, stop, restart and back up the Minecraft server, and use its console, from the
  desktop, the palette, the phone, and by asking the assistant.
- I can see every PC's health and sleep, wake, restart or shut them down, with confirmations.
- I get a phone alert within a minute if the Roblox client on Pluto crashes or disconnects,
  and I can relaunch it from the phone.
- The assistant can operate every module, asks before any `confirm` action, and every action
  appears in the activity log with who started it.
- The crash restart, stop-when-empty, weekly backup, disk alert and Roblox alert automations run
  unattended, including while the main PC is off.
- I can generate images on Pluto from chat or a button, and they land in the library on Pluto.
- The wake word works well enough that I leave it on.
- Installing on a fresh machine takes under 10 minutes following the onboarding.

**Out of v1:** multiple users, sharing modules, video/music, a sandbox for the assistant's
web browsing (web access stays `confirm`), code signing, macOS/Linux.

### Toolchain (pinned)

| Tool | Version policy | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Rust | stable, pinned in `rust-toolchain.toml` | `clippy -D warnings`, `rustfmt` |
| Node | 22 LTS, pinned in `.nvmrc` | also the runtime bundled with the assistant |
| pnpm | pinned via `packageManager` | workspaces |
| Python | 3.12, managed with `uv` | modules bundle their own venv |
| TypeScript | strict mode, `noUncheckedIndexedAccess` | Biome for lint and format |

### Code generation

`packages/protocol` (zod) → `pnpm gen:schema` → `schema/*.json` → `cargo run -p protocol-gen`
→ `crates/protocol/src/generated.rs` (via `typify`), plus Python pydantic models via
`datamodel-code-generator`. The generated files are committed, and CI fails if regenerating changes them.

> **Phase 0 status:** the `typify` step is deferred. With 9 message types, the Rust types
> in `crates/protocol` are written by hand, and the contract test (`crates/protocol/tests/fixtures.rs`)
> round-trips every zod fixture through them. A zod change that the Rust side doesn't follow
> fails CI. Switch to generation when the protocol grows past about 20 types (phase 2, with `chat.*`).
> Python modules don't need protocol models yet, because they only talk MCP.

### CI (GitHub Actions)

| Workflow | Runner | Jobs |
|---|---|---|
| `ci.yml` (push/PR) | `windows-latest` | Rust fmt/clippy/test · pnpm lint/typecheck/test · pytest for SDK + modules · codegen drift check · contract tests |
| `ci.yml` | `ubuntu-latest` | the same Rust/TS/Python unit tests (fast feedback, catches Windows-only assumptions) |
| `release.yml` (tag `v*`) | `windows-latest` | build desktop installer, node installer, module bundles, then sign the updater manifest and publish a GitHub Release |

## 3. Node daemon

Binary: `kerneld.exe` (Rust, tokio). One per machine. On Pluto it's built with the
`home` feature, which adds the Kernel services.

### Responsibilities

- Pairing and authentication with other nodes and the desktop app.
- Discovering, starting, supervising, updating and removing modules.
- Collecting module status and events and relaying them to subscribers.
- Running actions (checking permissions, recording them in the activity log).
- Running node-local automations (§6.3).
- Writing logs and producing diagnostics bundles.
- A tray icon: status, open logs, restart node, pause all automations.

### Running on Windows

- Runs **per user**, not as a Windows service, because modules need the user's session
  (desktop notifications, the GPU context for Forge, hypervisor CLI tools) and a tray icon.
- Autostart via `HKCU\...\Run`. On Pluto, Windows auto-login plus "never sleep" are documented
  setup steps (the Minecraft module's WSL keepalive only runs while kerneld does).
- One copy per user, enforced with a named mutex.

### Folders

```
%LOCALAPPDATA%\Kernel\node\
  config.toml          # node id, name, listen addrs, allowed folders, flags
  node.db              # SQLite (node-local tables, §9)
  logs\                # rotating, 10 × 10 MB
  modules\<id>\        # installed module code (read-only at runtime)
  data\<id>\           # per-module writable data
  runtimes\python312\  # bundled Python, shared by Python modules
```

The module source-of-truth folder is `D:\Kernel\modules` (configurable). Installing copies
it into `modules\<id>\` and builds a venv, so editing the source never breaks a running module.

### Supervising modules

- Each module is a child process, spawned with a clean environment (only `KERNEL_*`
  variables plus `PATH`, `SystemRoot` and `TEMP`) and its working directory set to `data\<id>\`.
- **Health:** the module must answer an MCP `ping` every 10s. Three misses → kill and restart.
- **Restart backoff:** 1s, 2s, 4s … up to 60s. More than 5 crashes in 5 minutes → state
  `failed` plus an alert, and no more automatic restarts until one is requested from the UI.
- Module stdout/stderr go to `logs\modules\<id>.log`.
- Graceful stop: an MCP `shutdown` notification, 10s grace, then kill.

### Networking

- Listens on `0.0.0.0:47800`. **The app** checks the source address against RFC1918 ranges
  and Tailscale `100.64.0.0/10` and rejects everything else. Belt and braces.
- The installer adds a Windows Firewall rule: TCP 47800, profile **Private** plus the
  Tailscale adapter only.
- TLS with a self-signed certificate per node. Peers pin each other's certificate fingerprint
  at pairing time (§4.2).

---

## 4. Kernel protocol

Everything runs over **one WSS connection** per peer pair (desktop↔node, node↔home node),
using JSON messages validated with the zod-generated schemas. MCP is used *inside* a node
(node↔module over stdio), not on the network.

### 4.1 Envelope

```jsonc
{ "v": 1, "id": "01J…", "type": "action.invoke", "ts": "2026-09-24T20:11:02Z", "body": { … } }
```

- `v`: protocol major version. A mismatch closes the connection with code 4001 and the
  UI shows "update required".
- Requests carry an `id`, and responses carry `re: <id>`.

### 4.2 Pairing

1. The new node's tray shows **Pair…**, which displays a 6-digit code and its certificate fingerprint.
2. In the desktop app, go to **Settings → Nodes → Pair a new node**, and enter the node's address and the code.
3. The desktop app connects over TLS, and both sides confirm the code with SPAKE2 (`spake2`
   crate), so the code is never sent in the clear.
4. After a successful exchange, each side stores the other's certificate fingerprint and a
   long-lived token in Credential Manager (`Kernel/<peer-id>`).
5. The home node is paired first. After that, the home node introduces new nodes to every
   existing client.

Unpairing deletes those records on both sides and closes live connections.

### 4.3 Message types (v1)

| Type | Direction | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `hello` / `welcome` | client → node | authenticate, exchange versions and capabilities |
| `catalog.get` → `catalog` | client → node | modules, manifests, actions, views, current status |
| `status.subscribe` / `status.update` | ↔ | streaming status for modules (≤ 4 Hz per module) |
| `event` | node → client | module events (`minecraft.server.crashed`, …) |
| `action.invoke` → `action.result` | client → node | run an action with params, the calling actor, and an optional approval id |
| `action.progress` | node → client | long-running actions (backup at 40%…) |
| `approval.request` / `approval.decide` / `approval.resolved` | ↔ | the approval flow (§6.2) |
| `activity.append` / `activity.query` | ↔ | activity log |
| `automation.*` | ↔ | create, update, enable, run now, list runs |
| `logs.tail` | client → node | live log view for a module or node |
| `diag.bundle` | client → node | produce a diagnostics zip |
| `chat.*` | desktop/phone → home | assistant conversation (§6.1) |
| `voice.*` | desktop → home | voice session streaming (§7.6) |

### 4.4 Errors

`action.result` with `ok:false` and an `error.code` of:

- `offline`
- `disabled`
- `not_permitted`
- `needs_approval`
- `invalid_params`
- `module_failed`
- `timeout`
- `busy`
- `internal`

Every error also carries a human-readable `message`.
The UI maps each code to one line of copy plus a suggested next step.

---

## 5. Module system

### 5.1 Manifest (`module.toml`)

| Field | Required | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `id` | yes | `[a-z][a-z0-9-]{1,31}`, unique per node |
| `name`, `icon`, `version` | yes | display name, Lucide icon name, semver |
| `runtime` | yes | `python` or `node` |
| `entry` | yes | entry file |
| `requires` | no | e.g. `platform = "windows"`, `commands = ["VBoxManage"]` |
| `[settings]` | no | typed settings with defaults, rendered as a form. Fields marked `secret = true` go to Credential Manager |
| `[status]` | no | status fields (typed), plus `sidebar` and `tiles` templates |
| `[[actions]]` | no | see below |
| `[[events]]` | no | `id`, `payload` schema, `description` |
| `[[views]]` | no | layout of UI blocks (§5.3) |

**Actions:**

| Field | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `id` | `noun.verb` (`server.start`) |
| `label`, `icon`, `description` | used on the button, in the palette, and as the tool description for the assistant |
| `params` | typed parameters (`int`, `float`, `string`, `enum`, `bool`, `path`) with constraints |
| `ai` | `safe`, `confirm` or `never` |
| `confirm_when` | expression that forces a confirm **for humans too** (e.g. `players > 0`) |
| `enabled_when` | expression over status. When false, the button is disabled, the tool is hidden and the reason is shown |
| `long_running` | enables `action.progress` and a cancel button |
| `timeout_s` | default 60 |
| `quiet` | `true` keeps a read-only, frequently polled action (like `console.tail`) out of the activity log. Only allowed on `safe` actions, so anything that needs a confirm is always logged |

A module can ship a `requirements.txt`. The installer and the self-updater install every
module's requirements into the node's Python environment, together with the SDK wheel.

Expressions use a tiny, side-effect-free language (`cel-interpreter` crate: comparisons,
`&&`, `||`, and field access on status only).

### 5.2 Module SDK

**Python**

```python
from kernel_sdk import Module, action, event, status

mod = Module("minecraft")

@mod.status(every=2.0)
async def current():
    s = await rcon.query()
    return {"state": s.state, "players": s.online, "max_players": s.max, "tps": s.tps}

@mod.action("server.start")
async def start(ctx):
    await vm_guest.run_server()
    await ctx.wait_until(lambda st: st["state"] == "running", timeout=180)
    return {"ok": True}

@mod.action("server.stop")
async def stop(ctx, delay_min: int = 0):
    if delay_min:
        await rcon.say(f"Server stopping in {delay_min} min")
        await ctx.sleep(delay_min * 60)
    await rcon.command("stop")

mod.run()
```

**TypeScript** has the same shape (`defineModule`, `action`, `status`) with zod params.

The SDK handles:

- validating the manifest against the code at start-up (missing handlers fail fast)
- MCP transport, pings and shutdown
- structured logging
- settings and secret access (`ctx.settings`, `ctx.secret("rcon_password")`)
- emitting events and progress (`ctx.emit`, `ctx.progress`)

### 5.3 UI blocks (v1 set)

| Block | Binds to | Used by |
|---|---|---|
| `toolbar` | actions (ordered) | all |
| `tiles` | status fields (+ optional meter) | Minecraft, PC monitor |
| `metrics` | per-device groups of meters | PC monitor |
| `console:<source>` | log/stream + command action | Minecraft (screen paste + log) |
| `table:<field>` | array status field, with row actions | players, backups |
| `list:<field>` | array status field | backups, alerts |
| `form:<action>` | action params | "generate image", settings |
| `gallery:<field>` | media items | AI media library |
| `note` | static text (markdown subset) | warnings like "Restore is button-only" |

The desktop app and the phone draw these blocks with the same `packages/ui` components.
There's no module-supplied UI code in v1 (a sandboxed iframe block comes **later**).

### 5.4 Lifecycle

| Stage | What happens |
|---|---|
| install | copy folder, validate manifest, create the venv or `pnpm install --prod`, register in `node.db` |
| enable / disable | start or stop the process. Disabled modules keep their settings |
| update | the source folder's version changed → the UI offers an update → stop, reinstall, start. Rolls back if start-up fails |
| remove | stop, delete code, keep `data\<id>\` unless "delete data" is checked |

---

## 6. Kernel services (home node)

### 6.1 Assistant runtime (local first, Claude as fallback: D20)

- **Our own tool loop** on the home node, not the Claude Agent SDK. The loop is small: send the
  conversation and the tool list, run the tool calls the model asks for (through the normal
  action path, so tiers, approvals and the activity log all apply), repeat. It talks to two
  backends through one interface:
  - **Local (default): Ollama on Pluto**, a ~8B model with good tool calling (e.g. Qwen 3 8B,
    Q4, about 5–6 GB of VRAM). It shares the 1080 Ti with Forge through the GPU queue, and is
    unloaded after 5 idle minutes so Forge and Roblox get the memory back. Free.
  - **Claude (fallback): the Anthropic Messages API** with an API key, **Haiku 4.5 by
    default** (the cheapest model), Sonnet only if chosen in Settings.
- **When it falls back to Claude:**
  - the local model fails twice in a row: no valid tool call, a made-up action, or bad params
  - you ask for it ("ask Claude …", or a button on the reply)
  - Pluto is unreachable or its GPU is busy past a timeout
  - Never silently: the reply is marked "Claude" with its cost, and the budget below applies.
- **Decision layer (LAYA, D21, as built in D26) runs first.** [LAYA](https://laya.convaiinnovations.com/)
  is a small local classifier (421M params, Apache 2.0) that answers choice / score / yes-no
  questions with probabilities, not text. It runs in the `laya` module; the node asks it with
  every message (one **choice** over every action plus "status of <module>", one **yes/no**
  "needs several steps?"):
  - Sure (≥ `laya_fast`, 0.9) the message asks how a module is doing → that status is read
    first, so the model answers in one round instead of two. **It never presses a button:**
    zero-shot, it is sometimes sure of the wrong one (see D26).
  - Optional (`laya_tools`): the model gets only LAYA's top N actions as tools.
  - Optional (`laya_claude`): "needs several steps" above the threshold → Auto asks Claude first.
  - Not built: the "does this call match?" check. Too slow or not running → skipped (and paused
    for 10 minutes after a timeout). It only changes what the model is given, never tiers.
- **tools:** built from the live catalog, `<module>__<action>`, description and JSON Schema
  from the manifest. No shell, file or web tools in v1. Only module actions.
- **permissions:** each tool call goes through the node's tier check plus `confirm_when`.
  `confirm` → an approval (§6.2), then wait.
- **context:** a compact status summary of the online modules, refreshed each turn. Kept
  short, since small local models get worse with long prompts.
- **persona:** a system prompt that makes it **Kernel**, the tsundere catgirl, editable in
  Settings → Assistant. Approval cards, errors and action descriptions come from the manifest
  and are never styled by the persona.
- **Account:** an Anthropic **API key** is optional. Without one, Kernel is local-only.
- **Conversations:** stored in `chats` (§9) by the node, whichever backend answered.
- **Save as automation:** takes the chat's successful tool calls as steps, has the model
  suggest which values should become inputs, and opens the automation editor pre-filled.

### 6.2 Approvals

State machine: `pending → approved | denied | expired | cancelled`.

- Created by the assistant, an automation step marked `confirm`, or a human action hitting
  `confirm_when`.
- Fanned out to: the desktop (inline in chat, plus a toast if the chat isn't open), the phone
  (top of the home screen), and a Windows notification with Approve/Deny buttons.
- The first decision wins. Expires after 10 minutes (setting) → treated as denied.
- Every step is recorded in `approvals` and the activity log.

### 6.3 Automation engine

**Built so far (D22):** `[[schedule]]` tables in node.toml run one action at a time
("daily 04:00", "sun 03:30", "every 30m"), in the node PC's local time, and skip missed runs.
The Node module shows the next and last runs. The engine below replaces them later.

**Definition format** (stored as JSON in `automations`, edited in the UI):

```jsonc
{
  "name": "Stop when empty",
  "trigger": { "type": "condition", "module": "minecraft", "when": "players == 0", "for": "15m" },
  "steps": [
    { "type": "action", "module": "minecraft", "action": "server.stop", "params": {} }
  ],
  "policy": { "concurrency": "skip", "missed": "skip", "retries": 0 }
}
```

- **Triggers:**
  - `schedule` (cron plus time zone)
  - `event` (module event id plus an optional filter)
  - `condition` (expression over status, plus an optional `for` duration)
  - `voice` (phrase, home node only)
- **Steps:**
  - `action`
  - `wait` (duration, or `until` an expression with a timeout)
  - `notify`
  - `assistant` (a prompt, with its output available to later steps)
  - `if` (expression, then/else)
- **Where it runs:** the home node computes this when the automation is saved. If every
  trigger and step touches one node's modules (and there's no `assistant` step), it's
  deployed to that node. Otherwise it stays on the home node. The UI shows "Runs on …".
- **Policies:**
  - `concurrency`: skip, queue or parallel
  - `missed` (for schedules when the node was off): skip or run once
  - `retries` with backoff
- Every run is written to `automation_runs`, with its step results and durations.

### 6.4 Claude API proxy

- A local HTTP server on `127.0.0.1` only, which the assistant process uses as `ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL`.
- The assistant gets a random bearer token per process start. The proxy swaps it for the
  real key from Credential Manager.
- Streams responses through unchanged, so prompt caching works.
- Records `usage` (input, output, cache read/write tokens) per request into `usage`, with
  the cost from a price table that ships with the app and can be edited.
- **Budget:** a monthly cap from settings (default **$3**; Claude is only the fallback). At 80% → notification. At 100% → requests get a
  402, the assistant tells the user, and automations with `assistant` steps pause.
- **Concurrency:** 4 requests in flight. Retries 429 and 529 errors with jittered backoff,
  respecting `retry-after`.

### 6.5 Notifications

**Built (D22):** modules report events with `mod.emit(kind, message, level)`. The node stores
them, pushes them to connected apps (the Events tab), and sends the ones `[notify]` picks
(level, include, mute) to a Discord webhook.

- Channels: desktop toast (through the desktop app, or through the node when the app is
  closed), the phone (web push via the PWA), and the activity feed.
- Per-category settings: approvals, alerts, automation failures, automation successes (off by default).

---

## 7. Desktop app

### 7.1 Windows and navigation

| Window | Notes |
|---|---|
| Main | a frameless custom title bar that keeps the Windows snap layouts. Sidebar + content |
| Palette | always-on-top, Alt+Space global hotkey, closes when it loses focus |
| Settings | a separate small window (960×640) |
| Toasts | native Windows notifications (`tauri-plugin-notification`) |

**Screens** (matching the design canvas):

- Assistant
- Automations (list + detail + editor)
- a Module screen per module (built from the manifest's views)
- PC monitor
- Activity log
- Settings (General, Assistant, Modules, Nodes, Permissions, Shortcuts)
- Onboarding

### 7.2 State and data

- **Rust side:** keeps connections to the home node and the local node, merges their catalogs,
  and exposes typed Tauri commands (`invoke`, `approve`, `subscribe`) plus events
  (`status`, `activity`, `approval`).
- **UI side:**
  - TanStack Query for request/response data
  - a small Zustand store for live status, fed by Tauri events
  - TanStack Router for screens (flat route list, no nesting)
- **Degraded mode:** if the home node is unreachable, the app connects directly to the other
  paired nodes. The assistant, automations editing and the library show "Home node offline",
  while module buttons keep working.

### 7.3 Design system

The canvas design is implemented as tokens:

- colors: `--bg`, `--side`, `--raise`, `--line`, text-1/2/3, accent, add, del, warn
- square corners everywhere
- Geist and Geist Mono
- Lucide icons at 1.5px stroke with square caps and miter joins

Components live in `packages/ui`:

- `Sidebar`, `Row`, `Kbd`, `Btn`, `ActionBar`, `Panel`, `Tile`, `Meter`, `Console`, `Table`,
  `Approval`, `Toggle`, `Picker`, `Composer`, `Feed`
- plus the §5.3 blocks built from them

Accessibility requirements: everything reachable by keyboard, visible focus rings, contrast
≥ 4.5:1 for text, and `aria-label` on icon-only buttons.

### 7.4 Keyboard

| Keys | Action |
|---|---|
| Alt+Space | palette (global) |
| Ctrl+K | palette (in app) |
| Ctrl+Space (hold) | push-to-talk |
| Ctrl+Enter / Esc | approve / deny the focused approval |
| Ctrl+L | activity log |
| Ctrl+, | settings |
| Ctrl+1…9 | jump to sidebar item |

Module actions can declare a suggested shortcut. Conflicts are resolved in Settings → Shortcuts.

### 7.5 Tray

- Menu: Open Kernel, Palette, Mic on/off, Pause automations, and Quit.
- Closing the main window hides it to the tray.

### 7.6 Voice

**Pipeline:**

```
mic (WASAPI, 16 kHz mono) → Silero VAD → openWakeWord ("Hey Kernel")
  → on trigger: faster-whisper on the MAIN PC's 1080 Ti (int8, `small.en`)
  → text sent to the home node as a chat turn
  → assistant reply → Kokoro TTS (Pluto CPU) → audio frames back → play
```

- **Latency budget** (from end of speech to first audio), ≤ 2.0 s:
  - VAD end-of-speech: 300 ms
  - STT: 500 ms
  - first assistant token: 700 ms
  - TTS first chunk: 300 ms
  - network: 200 ms
- **Barge-in:** if speech is detected while TTS is playing, stop playback and start a new turn.
- **Privacy:** before the wake word, audio never leaves the process, and a tray indicator
  shows the mic state. A setting lets you require push-to-talk only.
- **Fallback:** if Pluto is unreachable, voice is disabled and the tray shows why.
- **Wake word model:** "Hey Kernel" isn't a stock openWakeWord phrase, so it's trained with
  openWakeWord's synthetic-speech training notebook (a one-off, about an hour on the 1080 Ti),
  then tuned with ~50 real recordings of my voice plus an hour of background audio (Roblox
  and game sound included) to cut false triggers. The model file ships with the desktop app.
- **Running STT locally** on the main PC keeps the round trip off the network and leaves
  Pluto's GPU for Forge. Pluto's `speech.transcribe` is still available for other uses (e.g.
  transcribing files).

### 7.7 Onboarding (first run)

1. Welcome, and choose "This is my main PC".
2. Pair the home node (Pluto): the code-entry screen.
3. Enter the Anthropic API key. It's stored on the home node, never on the main PC.
4. Pair the other nodes, or skip.
5. Enable modules. Per-module setup forms appear (Minecraft shows its WSL settings with Pluto's defaults filled in).
6. Permissions: review the defaults.
7. Voice: mic test, wake word test, or skip.

---

## 8. Phone web app

- A Vite + React PWA sharing `packages/ui`, served by the home node at `/m/`.
- Reached through **Tailscale Serve** (HTTPS with a real certificate on the tailnet domain).
  Not reachable any other way.
- **Device login:** Desktop → Settings → Nodes → "Add phone" shows a QR code with a one-time
  code. The phone exchanges it for a device token, stored in the PWA's storage. Device tokens
  can be revoked in Settings.
- **Screens:**
  - Home: pending approvals, module cards with big action buttons, node status, recent activity
  - a Module detail screen built from the same views, with the console and tables simplified for small screens
  - Assistant chat
  - Activity
- Web push notifications (VAPID) for approvals and alerts.
- **iPhone:** web push only works once the PWA has been added to the Home Screen (iOS 16.4+),
  and push permission can only be requested after a tap. The device-login flow ends with an
  "Add to Home Screen, then tap Enable notifications" step with screenshots, and the home
  screen shows a banner until notifications are on.
- Touch targets ≥ 44 px, and it works in portrait at 360 px width.

## 9. Data model

### Home node (`kernel.db`)

| Table | Key columns |
|---|---|
| `nodes` | id, name, role, address, cert_fp, last_seen, version |
| `modules` | node_id, module_id, version, enabled, state, manifest_json |
| `activity` | id, ts, actor (`user`/`assistant`/`automation`/`phone`), actor_ref, node_id, module_id, action, params_json, result (`ok`/`error`/`denied`), error_code, duration_ms, approval_id |
| `approvals` | id, created_ts, requested_by, node_id, module_id, action, params_json, reason, state, decided_by, decided_ts |
| `automations` | id, name, definition_json, placement_node, enabled, created_from_chat |
| `automation_runs` | id, automation_id, node_id, started_ts, finished_ts, status, steps_json |
| `chats` | id, title, created_ts, updated_ts, sdk_session_id, model |
| `usage` | ts, request_id, model, in_tokens, out_tokens, cache_read, cache_write, cost_usd, chat_id |
| `library_items` | id, kind (`image`/`audio`), path, prompt, params_json, model, seed, source (chat/automation/button), created_ts, tags |
| `alerts` | id, ts, node_id, module_id, severity, text, resolved_ts |
| `devices` | id, name, token_hash, created_ts, last_seen (phones) |
| `settings` | key, value_json |

`library_items` also has an FTS5 index over the prompt and tags.

### Every node (`node.db`)

`module_settings`, `local_automations` (deployed copies), `local_runs` (synced up to the home
node when it's reachable), `status_cache`.

### Migrations

Uses `refinery` (Rust) with numbered SQL files, run on start-up. The database is backed up
to `*.db.bak` before each migration.

### Retention

- `activity`: 180 days
- `usage`: kept forever (it's small)
- `automation_runs`: 90 days
- logs: rotation limits

## 10. Module specs

### 10.1 Minecraft (`modules/minecraft`, runs on Pluto)

**The real setup** (settled, see D16): NeoForge 21.1.251 / MC 1.21.1 with about 30 mods in
`/srv/minecraft`, inside **WSL Ubuntu on Pluto**, run by systemd as the `minecraft` user
inside a detached `screen` session (`screen -DmS mc`, `SCREENDIR=/run/screen-mc`). My own helpers
(`mc-cmd`, `mc-ping`, `mc-console`) stay for manual use; the module doesn't call them (below). Other units: `playit` (the playit.gg tunnel that
is the only public way in, so no port forward and no exposed home IP) and `mc-notify` (Discord).
The old Forge 1.20.1 install stays in `/srv/minecraft-1.20.1` as a backup.

**How the module reaches it:** kerneld on Pluto runs the module on Windows, and the module pipes
small bash scripts (`modules/minecraft/scripts/*.sh`) to `wsl.exe -d Ubuntu -u root -- bash -s`
over stdin. Values go in as shell-quoted variables, never through cmd.exe quoting. There's no RCON
and no node inside Linux. Transports `ssh` (from another PC, `ssh pluto "wsl ... bash -s"`) and
`direct` (already on Linux, used by tests) exist too.

**WSL keepalive:** WSL shuts its VM down when no session is attached, which kills the server
(`vmIdleTimeout` doesn't help). The module holds `wsl -d Ubuntu -u root -- sleep infinity` open for
as long as it runs and restarts it if it ends. Status shows `keepalive`. Until kerneld runs as a
service at boot, keep `MC-KEEPALIVE.bat` as well.

**Settings** (`module.toml` defaults, per-machine `settings.local.toml`): `transport`, `distro`,
`ssh_host`, `server_dir`, `service`, `extra_services`, `backup_dir` (`/srv/minecraft-backups`),
`keep_backups` (1), `keep_wsl_alive`, `refresh_s`, `start_timeout_s`.

**Status** (refreshed every `refresh_s` by one script run, cached between polls):
`state` (`running`/`starting`/`stopping`/`stopped`/`crashed`/`unknown`; "running" means systemd
says active **and** the server answers pings), `players[]` (the ping's sample), `players_online`,
`players_max`, `version`, `motd`, `uptime_s`, `memory_mb` (the unit's cgroup), `mods_count`,
`services` (playit, mc-notify), `backups[]`, `last_backup`, `keepalive`. TPS is left out for now:
asking for it writes to the console every poll.

**Actions:**

| Action | Tier | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `server.start` | safe | `systemctl start`, then waits until pings answer (`start_timeout_s`) |
| `server.stop` | confirm | optional `delay_min` with a chat warning each minute, then `systemctl stop` |
| `server.restart` | confirm | `systemctl restart`, then waits for pings |
| `server.command` | confirm | one console line, pasted into the screen session; returns what the server logged after it |
| `server.say` | safe | chat broadcast |
| `console.tail` | safe | last N lines of `logs/latest.log` |
| `player.kick`, `player.op`, `player.deop` | confirm | names checked against `[A-Za-z0-9_]{3,16}` |
| `whitelist.add` / `whitelist.remove` / `whitelist.list` | confirm / confirm / safe | |
| `world.backup` | safe | `save-off` → `save-all flush` → waits for "Saved the game" → `tar.gz` of the world → `save-on` (always, via a trap) → **verify** (the archive reads and `level.dat` is valid gzip) → only then delete backups beyond `keep_backups`. Checks free space first. A failed verify keeps the old backup |
| `mods.list` | safe | jars in `mods/` |
| `service.restart` | confirm | `playit` or `mc-notify` |

Start, stop, restart and backup never overlap (the second one gets `busy`). Still to come:
`world.restore` (never, for the assistant), `confirm_when players > 0`, events (`server.crashed`,
`player.joined`, `backup.failed`, ...) and the weekly backup automation (phase 3; until then run
it by hand or from a timer).

**Console input:** the module pastes text into the screen session with `readbuf` + `paste`,
never `screen -X stuff` (which `mc-cmd` uses). `stuff` interprets `^M`, `\015` and `$VARS` in its
argument, so `say hi^Mop someone` would run **two** commands, and `server.say` is `safe` for the
assistant. Checked against real screen 4.9 (`tests/test_real_screen.py`). **Status** comes from
the module's own server list ping on localhost (a few lines of Python in `scripts/lib.sh`), so it
doesn't depend on `mc-ping`'s output format. Each script is wrapped in `{ }` with stdin detached,
because it arrives on bash's stdin.

**Testing:** `tests/test_scripts.py` runs the real scripts against a fake server folder, fake
`systemctl`, `screen` and `runuser`, and a TCP server that answers the status ping. `probe.sh` is a read-only check of the real server's
assumptions. From PowerShell, in the repo root:
`cmd /c 'ssh pluto "wsl -d Ubuntu -u root -- bash -s" < modules\minecraft\probe.sh'`
(PowerShell has no `<`, and piping with `Get-Content` can add CRLFs that break bash).

### 10.2 VM power (dropped)

Not needed: the server runs in WSL on Pluto, and the Minecraft module keeps WSL alive itself (§10.1).

### 10.3 PC monitor (`modules/pc-monitor`, every node)

- **Status:**
  - CPU % (and per core)
  - RAM used/total
  - disks used/total
  - GPU % / VRAM / temperature via NVML (`pynvml`; works on the 1080 Ti)
  - CPU temperature via LibreHardwareMonitor's WMI provider when installed (optional, otherwise hidden)
  - network throughput
  - uptime
- **Actions:**
  - `power.sleep` (confirm)
  - `power.restart` (confirm, 60s countdown, cancellable)
  - `power.shutdown` (confirm, same)
  - `power.wake` (safe, sends a Wake-on-LAN magic packet to a *peer's* MAC address)
- **Wake-on-LAN** needs "Wake on Magic Packet" enabled in Pluto's NIC settings and BIOS, and
  Windows fast startup turned off. This is a documented setup step, and the module has a
  "Test WoL" button.
- **Events:** `threshold.crossed` (disk > X%, GPU temp > Y°C, both configurable).

### 10.4 AI media (`modules/ai-media`, runs on Pluto)

- **Forge** (A1111-compatible API, launched with `--api`, optionally managed by the module):
  - `image.generate` → `/sdapi/v1/txt2img`
  - `image.edit` → `/sdapi/v1/img2img` (including inpainting masks)
  - `image.upscale` → `/sdapi/v1/extra-single-image`
  - model and LoRA lists → `/sdapi/v1/sd-models`, `/sdapi/v1/loras`
  - progress → `/sdapi/v1/progress`
- **TTS:** `speech.say` with Kokoro (CPU) by default, Piper as a light fallback, and XTTS
  (GPU) optional for voice cloning.
- **STT:** `speech.transcribe` with faster-whisper `small` or `medium` (int8 on the GPU,
  falling back to the CPU). It's also used by the voice pipeline.
- **GPU queue:** one GPU job at a time. Priority: voice > interactive image > automations.
  The queue shows in status and on the module screen.
- **Library:** every output is written to `D:\Kernel\Library\YYYY\MM\` with a JSON sidecar and
  inserted into `library_items`. Thumbnails are generated at 256 px.
- **Pinned versions:** a PyTorch and CUDA combination that supports compute capability 6.1
  (Pascal). It's recorded in `modules/ai-media/requirements.lock` and checked at start-up.

### 10.5 Roblox (`modules/roblox`, runs on Pluto)

Watches the Roblox client I leave AFK on Pluto. **Watching and relaunching only:** it never
sends input to the game or automates gameplay.

- **Settings:** `place_id` (optional, for rejoin), `alert_on_disconnect` (on), `auto_relaunch` (off).
- **Status:**
  - `state` (`closed`/`running`/`disconnected`)
  - `session_s`
  - `memory_mb`
  - `gpu_mem_mb`
  - `last_event` (text + time)
  - `place_name` if known
- **How it knows:**
  - the process list for `RobloxPlayerBeta.exe` (running, crashed, exited)
  - tailing the newest file in `%LOCALAPPDATA%\Roblox\logs\` for disconnect/kick lines
    (the patterns are kept in a config file, since Roblox changes its log format)
  - Roblox's own error window when present
- **Actions:**
  - `client.relaunch` (confirm): close the client if it's hung, then start it again
  - `client.rejoin` (confirm, needs `place_id`): open `roblox://experiences/start?placeId=<id>`
  - `client.close` (confirm)
- **Events:** `client.crashed`, `client.disconnected`, `client.closed`.
- **GPU note:** Roblox's VRAM use is reported to the AI media GPU queue, so Forge jobs size
  their batches to what's actually free.

### 10.6 Files (`modules/files`, runs on Pluto and the main PC)

- **Allowed roots** come from settings, and every path is resolved and checked against the
  roots, rejecting symlink escapes and `..`.
- **Actions:**
  - `files.list`, `files.read` (up to 10 MB), `files.search` (all safe)
  - `files.write`, `files.move`, `files.delete` (confirm)
  - `files.transfer` (between nodes, streamed in chunks, safe when the destination is empty)
  - `backup.folder` (copies a folder to a target with versioned snapshots, safe)
- **Backups:** the "second copy" job from ARCHITECTURE §8 is a `backup.folder` automation,
  off by default, and the UI nags until it's configured.

## 11. Security

**Threat model:**

| Threat | Mitigation |
|---|---|
| Something on the LAN or internet talks to a node | Firewall rule for Private/Tailscale only · source address check in the app · TLS with pinned certificates · per-peer tokens |
| A stolen phone | Revocable device tokens · `confirm` approvals still need an unlocked phone · approvals expire |
| Prompt injection (web pages, chat messages, player names in logs) | The assistant only has module tools · anything from the web can't trigger a `confirm` action without a human · `never` tier · status text is marked as data in prompts |
| The assistant reading secrets | The API key only exists in the proxy · module secrets only in that module's process · the assistant process gets a scrubbed environment |
| A buggy or rogue module | Its own process with a scrubbed environment and its own data folder · no network ports opened by modules (they reach out, nothing reaches in) · modules are local, trusted code (no marketplace) |
| A compromised Minecraft server (a bad mod, say) | It runs in WSL as the `minecraft` user, and the only public way in is the playit.gg tunnel. **WSL is weaker isolation than a real VM:** by default Linux can read Windows drives (`/mnt/c`) and start Windows programs. Recommended hardening in `/etc/wsl.conf`: `[automount] enabled=false` and `[interop] enabled=false` (Kernel doesn't need either; it calls *into* WSL, not out). Nothing in WSL holds a Kernel token |
| Mistaken destructive actions | `confirm_when` also applies to humans · restore is `never` · the activity log records who did what |

**Secrets inventory:** Anthropic key (home node), peer tokens (each node), device tokens
(stored hashed on the home node), and the Discord webhook, which stays where it is (`/etc/mc-notify/webhook`, root only).
Kernel's own secrets live in Credential Manager.

---

## 12. Testing

| Level | What | Tools |
|---|---|---|
| Unit | Rust crates, SDKs, modules (Minecraft scripts against fakes, backup logic, path checks, expression evaluation) | `cargo test`, `vitest`, `pytest` |
| Contract | zod ⇄ Rust ⇄ pydantic round-trip of every message type, using golden JSON fixtures | CI job |
| Module harness | `kernel-sdk test` runs a module against a fake node, asserts manifest ↔ handlers, and runs recorded scenarios | SDK |
| Minecraft | the real bash scripts against a fake server folder with fake `systemctl`/`screen`/`runuser` and a fake ping server, covering status, start, stop, commands and backup paths (`modules/minecraft/tests`) | pytest |
| Integration | A real node plus fake modules plus a test desktop client: pairing, approvals, automations placement, offline/reconnect | Rust integration tests |
| UI | component tests plus key flows (approve in chat, Minecraft start/stop, sleep confirm) against `tools/fake-node` | Playwright (web build of the UI) |
| Assistant | recorded-response tests for tool selection and approval behavior; a small eval set of 30 requests ("start the server", "is Pluto hot?") with expected tool calls | vitest + recorded responses |
| Manual | a release checklist on real hardware: WoL, sleep/wake, WSL keepalive, voice latency, fresh install | `docs/release-checklist.md` |

Coverage targets: 80% lines for `crates/node`, the SDKs, and the `minecraft` and `files`
modules. None for UI code, where behavior tests matter more.

---

## 13. Packaging, updates and releases

| Artifact | Format | Contents |
|---|---|---|
| Desktop app | Tauri NSIS installer, per-user | app + WebView2 bootstrapper + the local node |
| Node | NSIS installer, per-user | `kerneld.exe` + the bundled Python runtime + the firewall rule. On Pluto it also includes the assistant (bundled Node 22 + `packages/assistant`) and the phone PWA |
| Linux VM node | tarball + install script | `kerneld` (musl build) + a systemd user unit |
| Modules | folder zips attached to the release | copied into `D:\Kernel\modules` |

- **Updates:** the Tauri updater for the desktop app, and the node checks the same GitHub
  Releases feed. Both verify the updater signature (the key is kept offline). Nodes update
  one at a time, home node last. Protocol changes stay backward compatible within a major version.
- **Versioning:** one version for the whole repo (`vX.Y.Z`) and a changelog generated from
  Conventional Commits.
- **Unsigned for now:** document the SmartScreen "More info → Run anyway" step, and move to
  Azure Trusted Signing before sharing any further.

---

## 14. Phases, tasks and acceptance criteria

### Phase 0: test run (1–2 weeks)

- [x] Repo scaffold per §2 (Cargo + pnpm workspaces, Biome, uv), CI on Windows and Linux runners
- [x] Tauri window with the design tokens, sidebar, and a palette window on Alt+Space
  (`apps/desktop`). Module screens are generated from the catalog: action buttons (inputs go in
  a More menu, anything above `safe` needs a second click), status tiles, lists and tables, and
  a live console for modules with `console.tail` + `server.command`. Activity and Settings
  screens. The installer is a CI artifact. Node address and token live in local storage until
  pairing
- [~] `kerneld` skeleton: config, logs, WebSocket listener with token auth and a Tailscale-only
  address filter (home network opt-in, D19), module supervisor, activity log in SQLite, single-instance lock.
  **Still to do:** tray, TLS, SPAKE2 pairing between two machines over Tailscale
- [x] **Node install and self-update** (D17): CI publishes `node-build-N` on every merge to main;
  `scripts/install-node.ps1` sets up Pluto (scheduled task with a 5-minute watchdog, firewall
  rule for LAN + Tailscale); the built-in **Node** module has Check for updates / Install update /
  Restart node. Full cycle covered by `crates/node/tests/self_update.rs`
- [x] Python SDK "hello" module: status fields, four actions (one per tier, plus a timeout
  case), supervised with restart and backoff, covered by `crates/node/tests/e2e.rs`
- [ ] **Local brain test:** Ollama on Pluto with an ~8B model calls one module tool correctly through the tool loop, and falls back to Claude Haiku when it can't (D20)
- [ ] Decision recorded: the Tauri + Node process split holds (or switch to Electron)

**Accept when:** clicking a button in the desktop app on the main PC runs the hello action
on Pluto, the result appears in the activity log, and the assistant can call it from a
command-line harness.

### Phase 1: buttons (3–4 weeks)

- [ ] Protocol v1 message types from §4.3 except `chat.*`, `voice.*` and `automation.*`
- [ ] Module manifest parser and validator, UI blocks `toolbar`, `tiles`, `metrics`, `console`, `table`, `list`, `note`
- [~] **Minecraft** module (§10.1): actions, status, WSL keepalive and verified backups done and tested against fakes. **Still to do:** a run against the real server (`probe.sh` first), events, `confirm_when`
- [x] ~~**VM power** module~~ dropped: the server is in WSL on Pluto (D16)
- [~] **PC monitor** module (`modules/pc-monitor`): CPU, memory, disks, GPU via NVML, network,
  uptime; Sleep / Restart / Shut down (confirm, 60 s warning, Cancel) and Wake-on-LAN to named
  targets. **Still to do:** CPU temperature (LibreHardwareMonitor), threshold events, run it on the
  real PCs
- [~] **Roblox** module (`modules/roblox`, §10.5): process + log watching (state
  closed/menu/joining/in_game/disconnected, session time, memory, disconnect count), Rejoin /
  Relaunch / Close, optional auto-rejoin with a cooldown. Log markers are settings, taken from
  Bloxstrap's log reader. **Low-power AFK mode** (D18): allowlisted graphics flags, Roblox's frame
  cap, and once in game a hidden window, lower priority and Efficiency mode, with Show/Hide
  buttons. **Still to do:** a run on Pluto (measure the savings), events
- [ ] Activity log screen, and a basic `approvals` flow for human `confirm_when`
- [ ] Degraded mode when the home node is offline
- [ ] Onboarding steps 1, 2, 4, 5

**Accept when:** for 3 days, the Minecraft server and the PCs are managed only through Kernel
buttons, with no crashes that lose state, and Sleep on Pluto → Wake from the main PC works.

### Phase 2: assistant (3 weeks)

- [ ] The assistant tool loop with the Ollama and Claude backends and the fallback rules (§6.1), the tool catalog built from manifests, a status summary in context
- [ ] API proxy with usage metering, budget cap and concurrency limit
- [ ] Full approval flow (§6.2) in chat, toasts and notifications
- [ ] Assistant screen as designed: chat, tool-call rows, the approval card, and the live and activity panels
- [ ] Palette "Ask the assistant" mode
- [ ] Settings → Assistant and Permissions tabs
- [ ] 30-request assistant eval set passing ≥ 90% on the right tool and arguments, measured local-only, local + LAYA, and Claude
- [ ] LAYA decision layer: fast path, tool shortlist, Claude routing and call check, with thresholds from the eval set

**Accept when:** "start the server and tell me when it's up" and "stop it in an hour and
back up after" work end to end, with approval, the activity log shows who did what, and
the monthly cost is visible.

### Phase 3: automations + phone (3 weeks)

- [ ] Automation engine (§6.3) with node placement, the five starter automations (Minecraft crash restart, stop when empty, weekly backup, disk alert, Roblox alert), and a runs history
- [ ] Automations screen (list, detail, simple step editor) and "save chat as automation"
- [ ] Node-local execution and syncing runs back to the home node
- [ ] Phone PWA (§8) with device login, home, module screens, approvals, chat and web push
- [ ] Notifications settings

**Accept when:** with the main PC **off**, a forced Minecraft crash is restarted and I get
a phone notification, the weekly backup runs and replaces last week's, a Roblox disconnect
reaches my iPhone, and I can approve a stop from the phone.

### Phase 4: AI media + storage (3–4 weeks)

- [ ] **Files** module on Pluto and the main PC, including transfers and folder backup
- [ ] Minecraft backups moved to Pluto through Files, with `world.restore` enabled
- [ ] **AI media** module: Forge generate/edit/upscale, the GPU queue, Kokoro TTS, faster-whisper STT
- [ ] Library screen (gallery, detail, search, "more like this"), stored on Pluto with a main-PC thumbnail cache
- [ ] Assistant returns images inline in chat
- [ ] Second-copy backup automation, and nagging until it's configured

**Accept when:** "make a 16:9 wallpaper of a snowy pixel-art village" produces an image
in chat and in the library on Pluto, and a world restore from a Pluto backup works.

### Phase 5: voice + polish (3 weeks)

- [ ] Voice pipeline (§7.6): push-to-talk first, then the wake word, TTS replies, barge-in
- [ ] Train and tune the "Hey Kernel" wake word model. Target: under 1 false trigger per day with Roblox audio playing
- [ ] Latency measured and logged. p50 ≤ 2.0 s, p90 ≤ 3.0 s on the home network
- [ ] Onboarding step 7, a mic indicator in the tray and sidebar
- [ ] Installers (§13), the updater, export diagnostics, release checklist
- [ ] Accessibility pass (keyboard-only walkthrough of every screen)

**Accept when:** the v1 definition in §1 holds for a full week.

### After v1

Candidates, not commitments:

- a sandboxed module iframe block
- a Discord bridge module
- Home Assistant module
- a WSL2 sandbox for browsing tasks
- a low-power always-on box (Raspberry Pi) as a fallback home node and WoL relay
- code signing

---

## 15. Risks, open questions, decision log

### Risks

| Risk | Likelihood | Impact | Mitigation |
|---|---|---|---|
| The local model picks wrong actions | high | medium | Tiers and approvals still apply to every call · two failures fall back to Claude · the 30-request eval set runs against the local model too |
| Pluto restarting for Windows Update breaks the home node and the Roblox session | medium | medium | Pluto runs 24/7 (D13). Set active hours, pause auto-restart, and schedule update restarts for when I'm not AFK. Degraded mode on the main PC |
| 1080 Ti support dropped by PyTorch/CUDA | medium | medium | Pinned lockfile. CPU fallback for TTS and STT |
| WSL shuts down with no session attached, killing the server | high | high | The Minecraft module holds a session open. Keep `MC-KEEPALIVE.bat` until kerneld starts at boot |
| Voice false triggers or latency | medium | medium | Push-to-talk first, tunable wake threshold, measured latency |
| Scope creep | high | high | Phases gated on acceptance criteria. "After v1" list for new ideas |

### Open questions

Resolved: Minecraft runs in WSL Ubuntu on Pluto under systemd (D16) · Pluto runs 24/7 (D13) · TTS voice is Kokoro (D14) · backups (D15) · main PC GPU is a 1080 Ti (D14).

### Decision log

| # | Decision | Why |
|---|---|---|
| D1 | Windows-first, single user, unsigned | the audience is me |
| D2 | Tauri 2 + Rust node (the Node assistant process is dropped by D20) | small footprint and Rust experience |
| D3 | Pluto is the home node | needs to be always on for the phone, automations and the assistant |
| D4 | Modules are processes speaking MCP + a manifest | isolation, any language (Python/TS), assistant tools for free |
| D5 | Buttons = palette = phone = AI tools = automation steps (one action path) | "use it without AI", consistency, one permission check |
| D6 | Three AI permission tiers + `confirm_when` for humans too | safety without nagging |
| D7 | Assistant has module tools only in v1 (no shell/file/web built-ins) | limits the damage from prompt injection |
| D8 | UI blocks, no module UI code, in v1 | consistent look, no untrusted UI code |
| D9 | Automations run on the owning node when possible | keep working when the main PC or Pluto are off |
| D10 | Square, Raycast-style design, Geist, Lucide icons | per the design canvas |
| D11 | Name **Kernel**, wake word "Hey Kernel", tsundere catgirl persona | my choice. Persona never styles safety text |
| D12 | Anthropic API key, optional, for the Claude fallback. $3/month default cap (was $10 when Claude was the main brain) | subscription login isn't allowed for SDK-style apps; see D20 |
| D13 | Pluto stays Windows and runs 24/7 | Roblox AFK needs Windows. Being on 24/7 is exactly what the home node needs |
| D14 | STT on the main PC's 1080 Ti, TTS (Kokoro) on Pluto's CPU | lowest voice latency, and keeps Pluto's GPU free for Forge |
| D15 | Weekly Minecraft backup, keep 1, verify before deleting the old one | my choice. Verification removes the "zero good backups" window |
| D16 | Minecraft module drives WSL on Pluto through `wsl.exe` + bash scripts; no VM node, no RCON, no VM power module | that's how the server already runs (systemd + screen, playit.gg). One fewer node and secret |
| D17 | Nodes update themselves from GitHub Releases: every merge to main is a release, installs are a button (or `auto_install`), a helper swaps the app folder and rolls back on failure | updating Pluto shouldn't need a trip to Pluto. SHA-256 over HTTPS from the one configured repo; whoever can publish releases there can run code on the node, same as whoever can push to main |
| D18 | Roblox "low-power AFK mode" instead of a custom/headless client: allowlisted Fast Flags, Roblox's own frame cap, and Windows window/priority/EcoQoS controls | a truly headless client means patching or injecting into Roblox, which its anti-cheat (Hyperion) bans for and its terms forbid; Bloxstrap/Fishstrap already cover bootstrapping. Since 2025-09-29 only allowlisted flags work anyway |
| D19 | Nodes accept only Tailscale and localhost; the home network is opt-in (`allow_lan`), and the firewall rule is Tailscale-only | my choice. Tailscale encrypts the traffic (ws:// on the LAN isn't encrypted until TLS lands) and nothing else on the home Wi-Fi can reach Kernel |
| D20 | Local first: Ollama on Pluto answers, Claude (Haiku 4.5 via the API) is the fallback; our own tool loop instead of the Agent SDK | my choice, to keep it nearly free. The Agent SDK is Claude-only, and a plain tool loop serves both backends, drops the bundled Node runtime and the Windows packaging risk |
| D21 | A LAYA decision layer in front of the LLM: picks the action (fast path when confident and input-free), shortlists tools, routes hard requests to Claude, checks calls | a small local classifier is faster and cheaper than generation, and fewer tools means fewer bad calls from a small model. It never skips approvals |
| D22 | Events and alerts first, through a Discord webhook; plain `[[schedule]]` tables in node.toml before the full automation engine (§6.3) | Discord is already on my phone, so alerts work before the PWA and web push exist. Schedules cover the common case (nightly backup, weekly restart) now. They run as automations, and `confirm` actions need `approved = true` in the schedule itself |
| D23 | A VRAM module shares Pluto's GPU by priority: Ollama and ComfyUI are unloaded through their APIs, other apps are measured per process (Windows' own GPU memory counters) and closed only when marked, Roblox is never touched; `exclusive` apps (video gen) clear everything below them while busy | one 11 GB card runs the local LLM (D20), image and video generation, and the Roblox AFK client. Unloading beats crashing with out-of-memory, and busy ComfyUI jobs are never interrupted |
| D24 | LLM and image work take turns through local proxies (Ollama 11435, ComfyUI 8189); images queued around an LLM request are batched, with an LLM max wait against starvation; out-of-memory image jobs are retried once | model swaps cost seconds each, so grouping by model beats strict arrival order; the max wait keeps the assistant responsive. Proxies need no changes to Ollama or ComfyUI |
| D25 | The assistant runs inside kerneld: one tool loop over Ollama's /api/chat (through the VRAM proxy) with Claude Haiku 4.5 over the Messages API as the fallback; tools are module actions plus a status read; confirm-tier calls become Approve buttons the person presses as themselves. LAYA (D21) comes later as a shortlist/fast path in front of the same loop | the node already owns permissions, the activity log and the catalog, so the assistant gets them for free; approvals as buttons need no new approval protocol yet |
| D26 | LAYA ships as the `laya` module (installed from its page, model on the CPU by default) and only reads a status early, shortens the tool list (opt-in) or routes to Claude (opt-in); it never runs an action itself. Measured zero-shot on 16 Kernel-style requests with ~25 options: right tool first 11 times, in the top 4 15 times, but wrong answers at 95-100% confidence (e.g. "Stop AFK" for "put roblox in afk mode") and its small-talk yes/no was noise; ~2-3 s per message on a weak 4-core CPU | a status read is harmless when wrong; a button press isn't. Its similarity shortlist was far worse than letting it choose among all options at once, so it chooses among all of them (54 fit) |
| D27 | Flow Race (the user's own game, a separate repo) runs as the `flowrace` module: downloaded from GitHub and built with npm into the module's data folder, run with Node under a Kernel host (its `server/core` behind file-backed players, 127.0.0.1 only, a connection cap, /kernel/status), falling back to its own `server/main.ts` if the host stops fitting. Friends reach it through Tailscale Funnel (or Serve for tailnet only), switched on by a button-only action | the game stays its own project; one public address for the game alone keeps everything else Tailscale-only, and friends need nothing installed |
| D28 | Hands-off nodes: the app's Settings has Update now, an auto-install switch and an on/off switch per module, all button-only node actions (`update.auto`, `modules.enable`; `modules.list` is a safe read). They're kept in `data/node-prefs.json` and win over node.toml; a module switch restarts kerneld. New modules ship switched off and set themselves up when turned on (Flow Race fetches a portable Node.js LTS, LAYA installs its package) | updating and choosing modules shouldn't need a PowerShell session on Pluto; a new module still never starts without the person choosing it |
| D29 | Game modules share `kernel_sdk.webgame` (GitHub download, npm build, Kernel host or the game's own server, crash restarts, Tailscale share, portable Node.js); each game module is its manifest, a thin subclass and its own `kernel-host.ts`. OpenFork is the second (share port 8443 so both can be shared). New commits install by themselves every 30 minutes, only when nobody is connected (`auto_update`); a commit that fails to build isn't retried | one tested path for every game the user hosts; updating without cutting off a game in progress |
| D30 | kerneld serves a one-file web page at `/` (same port, same Tailscale-only filter, strict CSP) that speaks the normal WebSocket protocol with the node token: update Kernel and games ("Update everything" does games first, then Kernel), share games and copy their links, and switch modules. The desktop app gets an opt-in "install app updates automatically" | managing Pluto from a phone without the app; nothing new to secure, since the page holds no secrets and uses the existing token and tiers |
| D31 | Party Games (`modules/party`) is a self-contained Python module: an aiohttp server on 127.0.0.1 (one room, 4-letter code, a host page behind a per-PC key, phones over one WebSocket each) and pure game state machines (`partygames.py`) that copy Jackbox *mechanics* with original names and content. Sharing reuses `TailscaleShare`, split out of `WebGame`. | no Node build or second repo for games we write ourselves; game logic testable without a network |
| D32 | Party Games remembers between nights in its own SQLite file (`<data_dir>/party.db`, migrations by `user_version`): profiles (the phone keeps a device token; a new phone needs the profile's 4-digit PIN, PBKDF2-hashed, 5 tries then 10 minutes locked), every finished game, monthly seasons (last month's leader wears the crown), greatest hits, badges and head-to-head records. Only players in the room see it (host screen and their phones). A night recap goes to an optional Discord webhook when the room closes; game events go through Kernel's own alerts | a home server can remember the group without accounts; a PIN is enough proof among friends, and nothing new is exposed publicly |
